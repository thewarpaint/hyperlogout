# Hyperlogout!

A website that will log you out from popular internet services that *probably* implement logout in an unsafe
way.

Shameless clone of [superlogout.com](http://superlogout.com) built to learn
[React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and the
[Flexbox layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
